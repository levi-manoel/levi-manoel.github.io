        <h3>First downside of Devenv</h3>

        <p>
          Don't get me wrong, Devenv is a big hand on the wheel, but today I
          encountered what, for me, is a downside. I'm working on a project that
          uses Bun on the backend, and yesterday (I think) Bun 1.2 was released.
          But since the default on the team is to use Devenv, and it uses Nix, I
          need to wait for Bun to be updated in nixpkgs.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          This remember me a frustration I had these days. Normally, on my work
          notebook, I'm running NixOS, but one day I woke up and wanted to try
          something different, just to remember how a "normal system" works. So
          I went trying other distros.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, I tried Debian. It was good; I installed i3 and set up my work
          environment without Devenv, and it was much nicer than I remember. But
          I couldn't easily install some newer versions of some packages, and
          that's okay; it's the idea of the distro. Since I was in a "free time,
          nothing better to do" mood, I went with Arch,
          <em><strong>btw</strong></em
          >. Me like Arch. I followed the installation guide, booted, didn't
          work. I refollowed the installation guide, then booted, and katchow,
          didn't work. Clearly a skill issue with partitioning the disk, but
          third time's the charm. I went with GNOME on Arch because I like
          GNOME. Set up my work environment, and again, a much better experience
          than I remember. But life is hard, and apparently, my notebook likes
          NixOS. Why?
        </p>

        <p>
          The TypeScript LSP was very slow—20 seconds to show the suggestions of
          a type defined in the file, slow. Why not write code without
          autocomplete? I could give 200 reasons with another 100 reasons inside
          each one (database tables). And not only in Vscode, I used Neovim,
          also <em><strong>btw</strong></em
          >, and it was slow there too, I even installed a Neovim plugin that is
          faster that the LSP integration, it really was faster, like, 5 seconds
          faster. I tried to fix it; my friend tried to fix it; my friend who's
          my boss tried—no success. Last try to have a "normal" distro:
          Pop!_OS—not <em><strong>btw</strong></em
          >, I know. My previous everyday distro. I only switched from it
          because one day the kernel update broke my audio, and nothing fixed
          it. So, at the time, I tried NixOS (because a friend of mine talked a
          lot about it), and the TypeScript LSP was also slow.
        </p>

        <p>So I came back to NixOS, and the LSP was fast again.</p>
