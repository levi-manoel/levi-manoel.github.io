        <p>
          Hey, I'm Levi Manoel, a software engineer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, SQL, NoSQL, web
          development and Google Cloud Platform. Right now, I'm studying to become a data engineer, and I'm also getting
          my
          hands dirty with C.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I'm probably battling with Neovim — and losing most of the time – and coding.
