    <p>Hey, I’m Levi Manoel, a software engineer with experience in
    JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, SQL, NoSQL, web development and Google
    Cloud Platform. Right now, I’m studying to become a data engineer,
    and I’m also getting my hands dirty with C.</p>
    <p>When I’m not coding, I’m probably battling with Neovim — and
    losing most of the time – and coding.</p>
