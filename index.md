## Introduction

Hey, I'm Levi Manoel, a full stack developer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, SQL, NoSQL, web development and Google Cloud Platform. Right now, I'm studying to become a data engineer, and I'm also getting my hands dirty with C.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably battling with Neovim — and losing most of the time -- and coding.

## Projects

None at all, for now...
